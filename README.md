3D Puzzle videogame with neon-style visuals in which you need to use your light to explore and memorize the dark levels, and then draw the right path to help your friend Cubie escape.

It was developed in 48 hours from scratch for the Perpignan Game Jam. 3rd Prize Winner for the Best Videogame Award.

The player's main goal is to move the light throughout the level to explore it and find the right path to the exit, avoiding enemies and obstacles. Once explored, the light disappears and the player has to draw that path from memory, so the main character will follow it.

Developed in Unity. Code built in C#.
